### Realistic Toy Photography

**Star Wars toy photography** comes in different forms.

One of those forms is the _realistic toy photography_ form.

I.e., where when you look at the photograph, you cannot immediately tell whether it is a photo of real person or people in Star Wars costumes (either in a Star Wars film, or in cosplay), or a photo of toys.

Examples of _realistic Star Wars toy photography_ was shown in the [Examples](#examples) section.

(Another form of **Star Wars toy photography** is where the photographer wants the Star Wars action figure to look like a small toy in the photo.)

**This article is going to focus on _realistic Star Wars toy photography_.**


### Movie Special Effects

The _realistic Star Wars toy photography_ form has similarities to the **miniature models** used for creating certain **special effects** in the original 3 Star Wars movies.

Before computers became ubiquitous, _miniature models_ were often used for creating certain kinds of _special effects_ in movies. For example:…

( [source](http://nzpetesmatteshot.blogspot.com/2010/09/big-boys-toys-howard-and-theodore.html) )



Like many other movies of past eras, the original 3 Star Wars movies made extensive use of _miniature models_. For example:…

**In a lot of ways, _Star Wars toy photography_ follows the tradition of the original 3 Star Wars movies' use of _miniature models_ for creating certain _special effects_.**

Star Wars action figures and their vehicles are a type of _miniature model_ after all.


## Action Figures

After seeing and reading all of that, you may be interested in becoming a **Star Wars toy photographer** yourself.

If you want to do that, then one thing you should probably do is get yourself some **Star Wars action figures**.

There are a number of companies creating _realistic Star Wars action figures_ of various qualities, under various brands.

But before getting into that, let's talk about **scale**.


### Action Figure Scales

_Star Wars action figures_ come in different sizes.

We try to be precise about these different sizes by talking about: **scale**.

Some example _scales_ include the **¹⁄₆ scale**, and the **¹⁄₁₂ scale**.
These are also know as the **12 inch scale**, and the **6 inch scale** respectively.

I.e., **¹⁄₆ scale** = **12 inch scale**.

And **¹⁄₁₂ scale** = **6 inch scale**.

Action figures in the **¹⁄₆ scale** (i.e., **12 inch scale**) are bigger.
Tend to have a fantastic level detail.
But are also very expensive for many people.

Action figures in the **¹⁄₁₂ scale** (i.e., **6 inch scale**) are smaller.
Tend to have OK detail (although not the best).
But are a more affordable option for many people.

So, what do we really mean by **scale**.…


#### 1/6 Scale

One scale is known as the **¹⁄₆ scale**.
Many people also write this as: **1/6 scale**.

This is also sometimes called the **12 inch scale**.
Which is also sometimes written: **12" scale**.

Let's imagine that a real human in a Stormtrooper costume is 6 feet tall.

Then if we were to make an action figure of this 6 foot tall person at _¹⁄₆ scale_ (as companies such as Hot Toys, and Sideshow do), then the action figure would be 12 inches tall.

Why?! Well because: 6 feet × ¹⁄₆ = 1 foot = 12 inches.

(That is where the alternate name “12 inch scale” comes from.)

Let's do another example for the **¹⁄₆ scale**:

An AT-ST is 28 feet tall.

So then at the _¹⁄₆ scale_ the AT-ST would be 56 inches tall.

Why?! Well because: 28 feet × ¹⁄₆ = 336 inches × ¹⁄₆ = 56 inches. (Or 4 foot 8 inches tall.)

Companies that make _Star Wars action figures_ in the **¹⁄₆ scale** include:

* [Hot Toys](http://www.hottoys.com.hk/), and
* [Sideshow](https://www.sideshowtoy.com/).

_Star Wars action figures_ at the **¹⁄₆ scale** tend to be at a very high level of quality.
And have the a fantastic level of detail.

(Keep in mind that the higher the level of detail, the better close-ups photos of the action figure will look.)

But _Star Wars action figures_ in the **¹⁄₆ scale** tend to cost **A LOT** more than, for example, _Star Wars action figures_ in the _¹⁄₁₂ scale_.

A single _Star Wars action figure_ in the **¹⁄₆ scale** can cost hundreds of dollars.

Some are willing to spend that kind of money to get _Star Wars action figures_ in the **¹⁄₆ scale**.

Some aren't (or can't) and stick to less expensive _Star Wars action figures_ at the _¹⁄₁₂ scale_.
