### Realistic Toy Photography

**Star Wars toy photography** comes in different forms.

One of those forms is the _realistic toy photography_ form.

I.e., where when you look at the photograph, you cannot immediately tell whether it is a photo of real person or people in Star Wars costumes (either in a Star Wars film, or in cosplay), or a photo of toys.

Examples of _realistic Star Wars toy photography_ was shown in the [Examples](#examples) section.

(Another form of **Star Wars toy photography** is where the photographer wants the Star Wars action figure to look like a small toy in the photo.)

**This article is going to focus on _realistic Star Wars toy photography_.**


### Movie Special Effects

The _realistic Star Wars toy photography_ form has similarities to the _miniature models_ used for creating certain _special effects_ in the original 3 Star Wars movies.

Before computers became ubiquitous, _miniature models_ were often used for creating certain kinds of _special effects_ in movies.

Like many other movies of past eras, the original 3 Star Wars movies made extensive use of _miniature models_.

**In a lot of ways, **Star Wars toy photography** follows the tradition of the original 3 Star Wars movies' use of _miniature models_ for creating certain _special effects_.**

Star Wars action figures are a type of _miniature model_ after all.
