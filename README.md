If you were to browse those hashtags you would see _a lot_ of **Star Wars toy photography** photos.

And Instagram even lets you _follow_ hashtags.

### Realistic Toy Photography

**Star Wars toy photography** comes in different forms.

One of those forms is the _realistic toy photography_ form.

I.e., where when you look at the photograph, you cannot immediately tell whether it is a photo of real person or people in Star Wars costumes (either in a Star Wars film, or in cosplay), or a photo of toys.

Examples of _realistic Star Wars toy photography_ was shown in the [Examples](#examples) section.

(Another form of **Star Wars toy photography** is where the photographer wants the Star Wars action figure to look like a small toy in the photo.)

**This article is going to focus on _realistic Star Wars toy photography_.**


### Movie Special Effects

The _realistic Star Wars toy photography_ form has similarities to the **miniature models** used for creating certain **special effects** in the original 3 Star Wars movies.

Before computers became ubiquitous, _miniature models_ were often used for creating certain kinds of _special effects_ in movies. For example:…

![Howard and Theodore Lydecker's miniature train](photos/fxhistory/lydecker_miniature_train.jpeg)

( [source](http://nzpetesmatteshot.blogspot.com/2010/09/big-boys-toys-howard-and-theodore.html) )



Like many other movies of past eras, the original 3 Star Wars movies made extensive use of _miniature models_. For example:…



![Photo of AT-AT miniature model use in a Star Wars movie](photos/fxhistorysw/at-at.jpeg)

( [source](https://www.starwars.com/news/the-5-most-grueling-star-wars-visual-effects) )



![Photo of Lando puppet used in a Star Wars movie](photos/fxhistorysw/lando_puppet.jpeg)

( [source](https://propstoreauction.com/view-auctions/catalog/id/78/lot/18558/) )



**In a lot of ways, _Star Wars toy photography_ follows the tradition of the original 3 Star Wars movies' use of _miniature models_ for creating certain _special effects_.**

Star Wars action figures and their vehicles are a type of _miniature model_ after all.


## Action Figures

After seeing and reading all of that, you may be interested in becoming a **Star Wars toy photographer** yourself.

If you want to do that, then one thing you should probably do is get yourself some **Star Wars action figures**.


### Action Figure Recommendations

If you have no idea what **Star Wars action figures** to start off getting, and just want a recommendation, then here it is:…

**Tip #1**:

Start off getting one or two **Star Wars action figures** from this list:

* Boba Fett,
* Captain Phasm,
* Captain Rex,
* Clone Trooper,
* Death Trooper,
* First Order Executor,
* First Order Riot Control Storm Trooper,
* First Order Storm Trooper,
* First Order Storm Trooper Heavy Gunner,
* Flame Trooper,
* Hover Tank Commander,
* Jango Fett,
* Mimban Storm Trooper,
* Patrol Trooper,
* Praetorian Guard,
* Range Trooper,
* Sand Trooper,
* Sand Trooper Corporal,
* Sand Trooper Squad Leader,
* Scout Trooper,
* Shadow Scout Trooper,
* Shadow Guard,
* Shadow Trooper,
* Shock Trooper,
* Shore Trooper,
* Snow Trooper,
* Storm Trooper,
* Storm Trooper Officer,
* Storm Trooper with Extra Gear.

**Obviously you do NOT need to buy all of these _Star Wars action figures_ to get started with _Star Wars toy photography_.**

Just pick one or two things from that list, to get started.

(If you are curious, I started off with an S.H.Figuarts _Death Trooper_.)

(Knowing what I know now I'd say that was probably a good choice for a first Star Wars action figure, as S.H.Figuarts tend to be more _posable_ than the alternatives in the ¹⁄₁₂ scale — in the 6 inch scale;
and often have a higher level of detail than the alternative brands in the ¹⁄₁₂ scale — in the 6 inch scale.)

(But my collection at the ¹⁄₁₂ scale -- at the 6 inch scale -- is made up of both _S.H.Figuarts Star Wars_ action figures, and _Hasbro Star Wars The Black Series_ action figures.)

(The _Hasbro Black Series_ action figures are less expensive than the _S.H.Figuarts_. But the _S.H.Figuarts_ tend to be more posable, and have better details than the _Hasbro Black Series_ action figures.)

(But anyway,…)

Basically start of with **Star Wars action figures** that, _in the movies_, have helmets and body suits that are mostly made up of hard parts.

Why?!… Because that you cannot see the eyes, the skin, and (what should be but often isn't) soft clothes on these action figures makes it is easier to take a _good_ looking photos with these action figures.

And when you are starting off with _Star Wars toy photography_, not adding that complexity is probably a good idea.

(Later on you can try action figures that are outside of this.)


**Tip #2**:

Start with **¹⁄₁₂ scale** of **Star Wars action figures**.

**¹⁄₁₂ scale** are also called **6 inch scale** action figures.

If you want to keep the price as low as possible, then go for the **6 inch scale** version of the **Hasbro Star Wars The Black Series** line of **Star Wars action figures**.

(WARNING: **Hasbro Star Wars The Black Series** comes in 2 different sizes. The larger **6 inch scale**. And the smaller _3.75 inch scale_.
If you are going to use the _Hasbro Star Wars The Black Series_ line for **Star Wars toy photography**, then I would recommend the _6 inch scale_ version (over the _3.75 inch scale_ version)).

(You can also mix the _6 inch scale_ version of the _Hasbro Star Wars The Black Series_ line, with the _S.H.Figuarts Star Wars_ line which is also at the _6 inch scale_.)

If you are OK with paying a bit more, to get better higher level of detail, and better posability in your _Star Wars action figures_, then go for **S.H.Figuarts Star Wars** action figures.

(If you are curious, I have _both_ **S.H.Figuarts Star Wars** action figures, and **Hasbro Star Wars The Black Series** action figures.)



### Action Figure Scales

_Star Wars action figures_ come in different sizes.

We try to be precise about these different sizes by talking about: **scale**.

Some example _scales_ include the **¹⁄₆ scale**, and the **¹⁄₁₂ scale**.
These are also know as the **12 inch scale**, and the **6 inch scale** respectively.

I.e., **¹⁄₆ scale** = **12 inch scale**.

And **¹⁄₁₂ scale** = **6 inch scale**.

Action figures in the **¹⁄₆ scale** (i.e., **12 inch scale**) are bigger.
Tend to have a fantastic level detail.
But are also very expensive for many people.

Action figures in the **¹⁄₁₂ scale** (i.e., **6 inch scale**) are smaller.
Tend to have OK detail (although not the best).
But are a more affordable option for many people.

So, what do we really mean by **scale**.…


#### 1/6 Scale

One scale is known as the **¹⁄₆ scale**.
Many people also write this as: **1/6 scale**.

This is also sometimes called the **12 inch scale**.
Which is also sometimes written: **12" scale**.

Let's imagine that a real human in a Stormtrooper costume is 6 feet tall.

Then if we were to make an action figure of this 6 foot tall person at _¹⁄₆ scale_ (as companies such as Hot Toys, and Sideshow do), then the action figure would be 12 inches tall.

Why?! Well because: 6 feet × ¹⁄₆ = 1 foot = 12 inches.

(That is where the alternate name “12 inch scale” comes from.)

Let's do another example for the **¹⁄₆ scale**:

An AT-ST is 28 feet tall.

So then at the _¹⁄₆ scale_ the AT-ST would be 56 inches tall.

Why?! Well because: 28 feet × ¹⁄₆ = 336 inches × ¹⁄₆ = 56 inches. (Or 4 foot 8 inches tall.)

Companies that make _Star Wars action figures_ in the **¹⁄₆ scale** include:

* [Hot Toys](http://www.hottoys.com.hk/), and
* [Sideshow](https://www.sideshowtoy.com/).

_Star Wars action figures_ at the **¹⁄₆ scale** tend to be at a very high level of quality.
And have the a fantastic level of detail.

(Keep in mind that the higher the level of detail, the better close-ups photos of the action figure will look.)

But _Star Wars action figures_ in the **¹⁄₆ scale** tend to cost **A LOT** more than, for example, _Star Wars action figures_ in the _¹⁄₁₂ scale_.

A single _Star Wars action figure_ in the **¹⁄₆ scale** can cost hundreds of dollars.

Some people are willing to spend that kind of money to get _Star Wars action figures_ in the **¹⁄₆ scale**.

Some aren't willing (or can't) and stick to less expensive _Star Wars action figures_ at the _¹⁄₁₂ scale_.

(FWIW, I do have some **¹⁄₆ scale** _Star Wars action figures_ from both _Hot Toys_, and _Sideshow_.
But I have A LOT more _Star Wars action figures_ at the _¹⁄₁₂ scale_ _from S.H.Figuarts_, and _Hasbro The Black Series_.)


#### 1/12 Scale

At least at the time of writting, the **¹⁄₁₂ scale** is much more popular (in terms of usage) for _Star Wars toy photography (than the _¹⁄₆ scale_)._

The **¹⁄₁₂ scale** is also written as: **1/12 scale**.

This is also sometimes called the **6 inch scale**.
Which is also sometimes written: **6" scale**.

Let's go over the same examples as before, to make things clear(er) around the **¹⁄₁₂ scale**.

Again, let's imagine that a real human in a Stormtrooper costume is 6 feet tall.

Then if we were to make an action figure of this 6 foot tall person at _¹⁄₁₂ scale_ (as companies such as S.H.Figuarts, Hasbro, Bandai, and Medicom do), then the action figure would be 6 inches tall.

Why?! Well because: 6 feet × ¹⁄₁₂ = ¹⁄₂ foot = 6 inches.

(That is where the alternate name “6 inch scale” comes from.)

Let's do another example for the **¹⁄₁₂ scale**:

An AT-ST is 28 feet tall.

So then at the _¹⁄₁₂ scale_ the AT-ST would be 28 inches tall.

Why?! Well because: 28 feet × ¹⁄₁₂ = 336 inches × ¹⁄₁₂ = 28 inches. (Or 2 foot 4 inches tall.)

Companies that make _Star Wars action figures_ in the **¹⁄₁₂ scale** include:

* [Bandai](http://www.bandai.com/),
  * S.H.Figuarts,
  * Model Kit,
* [Medicom](http://www.medicomtoy.co.jp/),
  * Mafex,
* [Hasbro](https://hasbro.com/),
  * The Black Series

_Star Wars action figures_ at the **¹⁄₁₂ scale** tend to have OK (although not the best) quality.
And have OK (although not the best) level of detail.

(Keep in mind that the higher the level of detail, the better close-ups photos of the action figure will look.)

But _Star Wars action figures_ in the **¹⁄₁₂ scale** tend to be the more affordable option than, for example, _Star Wars action figures_ in the _¹⁄₆ scale_.

A single _Star Wars action figure_ in the **¹⁄₁₂ scale** will probably cost between $10 to $100.


## First Photographs

Now that you have one or two _Star Wars action figures_ you are ready to take your first photos.

Here is the thing, your first set of photos probably won't be very good 🙂

Or at the very least, they probably won't be as good as the _Star Wars toy photography_ photos that you have seen others create that you feel are amazing.

But that's OK 🙂

You get better at _Star Wars toy photography_ by doing it.
I.e., you learn by doing.

FWIW, here is one of my first attempts at _Star Wars toy photography_ photos:

![Latent Imperium #3](photos/examples/latentimperium_3.jpeg)

It is OK. But not great. It doesn't make me think “wow”, in the same way the some of the photos I've seen from other _Star Wars toy photographers_.

But each time I take a photo, I try to figure out _why_ it doesn't look as good as other photos I've seen, and try to use that to improve my next photo.

I don't think I am the only person who has done this.

If you look at the first dozen photos of some of the _Star Wars toy photographers_ on_ Instagram with, what are today are, amazing _Star Wars toy photography_, their first photographs often weren't very good either 🙂

But they were able to produce amazing works over time.


## Dioramas

One way of improving your photos is to make use of a **diorama**.

You can see that in use with the following photos:
